%% Creating algorithms with the Pattern Recognition Toolbox
%
% One of the most useful features of the Pattern Recognition Toolbox is the
% ability to create <./functionReference/prtAlgorithm.html prtAlgorithm> objects.
% prtAlgorithm objects allow you to combine together prtAction objects, and
% then train and run them as if they were a single object.

%% Creating a prtAlgorithm object
% The easiest way to create prtAlgorithm objects is to use the overloaded
% + and - operators. The following simple example connects a pre
% processing object to a classifier, in series.

ds = prtDataGenUnimodal;    % Load a dataset
preProc = prtPreProcPca;    % Create a pre processing object
classifier = prtClassGlrt;  % Create a generalized likelihood ratio 
                            % classifier

algo = preProc + classifier;  % Cascade the 2 objects together
results = algo.kfolds(ds,3);  % Perform kfolds validation

%%
% Note that you use the prtAlgorithm object in exactly the same maner as
% you would any other prtAction object such as a classifier or
% preprocessor.
%
%% Plotting a prtAlgorithm object
% If you want to display the objects that make up a prtAlgorithm object,
% you can call the plot function:

plot(algo)   % Alternatively, algo.plot();

%% Overloaded operators
% To add an object to the left or right of the processing chain, use the +
% operator. Suppose for example, you wanted to add a decision object after the prtClass object,
% and you also wanted to normalize the input data so that it was zero-mean
% and unit variance prior to performing PCA. You could do that with the
% following commands:

%Or: algo = prtPreProcZmuv + algo + prtDecisionBinaryMinPe;
algo = prtPreProcZmuv + algo;
algo = algo + prtDecisionBinaryMinPe;

algo.plot();

%%
% Now you can train, run, or crossvalidate the algorithm just like any
% other prtAction. 

results = algo.kfolds(ds,3);

%% Connecting objects in parallel
% You can use the / and \ operators to connect objects in parallel in a
% prtAlgorithm. There is no difference in functionality between these two
% operators, they just control where the object gets placed when displayed
% with the plot command.
%
% As an example, create a new algorithm that normalizes the data, and then
% feeds the result into 2 prtClass objects, operating in parallel.  The
% results of these two classifiers are then fused together in another
% classifier

clear all;                % Clear the current objects
ds = prtDataGenUnimodal;  % Load a dataset


algo = prtPreProcZmuv + prtClassMap/prtClassGlrt + prtClassMap;
algo = algo.train(ds);

plot(algo)
%%
% Note, this is not a particularly good classifier, it is only intended as
% a simple example of how to combine prtActions into a prtAlgorithm.

%% Accessing the inddividual actions in the actionCell
% Inside each prtAlgorithm, there is a data member called actionCell. This
% is a cell array which contains all of the individual actions that make up
% the prtAlgorithm object. You can index into this cell array to set
% properties, or call methods, on the underlying prtAction objects. For
% example, suppose you would like to plot the decision region contours of
% the second prtClassMap classifier in the previous example. You could do
% so in the following manner:

algo.actionCell{4}.plot
