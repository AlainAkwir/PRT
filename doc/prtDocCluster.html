%% PRT Clustering Objects
% Clustering is an operation very similar to classification. The main
% difference is that in clustering, the class labels are unknown.
% Instead of using known class labels, clustering sorts the data into
% discrete clusters, which are given integer labels. It is important to
% remember that when using clustering algorithms, the assignment of labels
% to clusters is completely arbitrary. For example, if you train a
% clustering algorithm with the same set of data twice, it is possible that
% the same sample could be labeled class 0 the first time, and class 1 the
% second time.
%
%% Clustering object methods and properties.
% All prtCluster objects inherit the TRAIN, RUN, CROSSVALIDATE and KFOLDS
% functions from the prtAction object, for more information on these
% methods, refer to section on the  <./prtDocEngine.html prtEngine>.
%
%
%% Using clustering objects
% You use classifiers in the same manner as any prtAction object. The
% following example shows how to create a k-means cluster object, and plot
% the decision regions.

ds = prtDataGenUnimodal;       % Load a dataset to use
cluster = prtClusterKmeans     % Create k-means clustering object
cluster.nClusters = 2;         % Set the number of clusters to 2
cluster = cluster.train(ds);
plot(cluster)

%% 
% Note that in the above example, it was necessary to set the number of
% clusters to 2. This is an obvious choice because it is known that the
% data contains 2 classes. Clustering can also be done on M-ary data sets.
% For example:

ds = prtDataGenMary;
cluster.nClusters = 3;
cluster = cluster.train(ds);
plot(cluster)

%%
% In the above example, again the number of clusters in the orignal data
% was known to be 3, so the nClusters data member was set accordingly.
% Currently, all prtCluster algorithms require the number of clusters to be
% set before training.

%% Internal Deciders
% Another important property of prtCluster objects is the internalDecider.
% Ordinarily, a prtCluster object outputs raw statistics based on the
% clustering algorithm, just like the prtClass objects do. However, you
% might just want the clustering object to also label the outputs. This can
% be done by setting the internalDecider property to be a
% prtDecision object. In this case, since our classifier is an M-ary
% classifier, we need to set the internal decider to be a prtDecisionMap
% object:

cluster.internalDecider = prtDecisionMap;
result = cluster.kfolds(ds,2);   %  Perform a simple 2-fold cross-validation

%%
% All clustering objects in the Pattern Recognition Toolbox have the same
% API as discussed above. The only difference is the underlying clustering
% algorithms used to train and run. For a list of all the different
% clustering algorithms, and links to their individual help entries,
