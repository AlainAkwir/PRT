%%
% In the Pattern Recogntion toolbox, all actions (classification,
% regression, etc...) are implemented as  <./functionReference/prtAction.html prtAction>
% objects. All prtAction objects share fundamental operations
% such as training, running and validating results share this common API.
% There are 4 methods, <./functionReference/prtAction/train.html train>,
% <./functionReference/prtAction/run.html run>, 
% <./functionReference/prtAction/crossValidate.html crossValidate>,
% <./functionReference/prtAction/kfolds.html kfolds>, and
% <./functionReference/prtAction/optimize.html optimize>.
%
%% Training
% Training is the first fundamental method in the Pattern Recognition
% Toolbox. Training occurs whenever a PRT object needs to learn some
% parameters from the data. All PRT objects require that training be done
% before the run function can be called. Training can be supervised or
% unsupervised, depending on the action. Supervised training makes use of
% labeled PRT data sets. A common example of supervised training is
% classification, where a classification objsct is trained using labeled
% datasets, and then performs classification on an unlabeled data set. For
% example:

ds = prtDataGenUnimodal;
classifier = prtClassGlrt;
classifier = classifier.train(ds);

%% 
% Note that ds is a labeleled prtDataSetClass object. The object
% 'classsifier' is now a trained generalized likelihood ratio
% test classifier. 

classifier.isTrained 

%%
% Unsupervised learing is when labels are not necessary for training. An
% example of this would be clustering. Suppose we remove the labels from
% ds, and train a K-means clustering algorithm:

ds = ds.setY([]); % setY is a shortcut for setTargets

% Create a K-means clustering object with 2 clusters.
cluster = prtClusterKmeans('nClusters', 2);  
cluster = cluster.train(ds);

%%
% The 'cluster' object is now a trained prtClusterKmeans object, and the
% run function can be invoked. Note, if you try to train a supervised
% object with unlabeled data, you will get an error. If you train an
% unsupervised object with labeled data, the labels are ignored.

%% Run
% The next fundamental method in the Pattern Recognition Toolbox is the run
% function. Invoking the run method calls whatever functionaly the
% prtAction object implements. For example, calling run on a prtClassGlrt
% object will perform the likelihood ratio test and output the likelihood
% ratio values. The result will be stored in a prtDataSet. 
%
% For example, create a new dataset, drawn from the same distribution
% as our training dataset ds:

dsTest = prtDataGenUnimodal;

%%
% Now, call the run function, and pass the test data set:

result = classifier.run(dsTest)

%%
% Have a look at the first few elements of the result dataset:

result.getX(1:5)    % getX() is a shortcut for getObservations()

%% 
% The values in results.observations correspond to the values of the
% likelihood ratio test for each observation in dsTest, as performed by the
% classifier that was trained with the data from the dataset ds. To make a
% decision based on these outputs, you will need to use a
% <./functionReference/prtDecision.html prtDecision> Object.
%
% The cluster object operates in exactly the same way:

result = cluster.run(dsTest)

%%
% However, the output is different for clustering. In this case the
% elements are assigned to a particular cluster:

result.getX(1:5,:)

%% 
% Indicating that the first 5 results correspond to either class 1 or class
% 2. Note in clustering there is some ambiguity because cluster labeling is
% arbitrary.

%% Cross Validation
%
% <./functionReference/prtAction/crossValidate.html Cross validation> allows you to
% perform training and running of an action in one command, by partitioning
% a labeled dataset into training and test data using keys. This also
% ensures that all data will be used for both training and testing. To
% illustrate, here is an example of how to use this functionality with a
% PRT clustering object:

keys = mod(1:ds.nObservations,3)'; % The keys will have values 1, 2 and 3
result = cluster.crossValidate(ds,keys);

%%
% This divides the dataset ds into 3 partitions, or folds. To test the
% first fold, the classifier will first be trained with the 2nd and 3rd
% folds. Then the classifier will be run using the data in the 1st fold.
% This will be repeated for all folds.
%
% The keys must be a single column vector, with the same number of
% observations in the data set.  In the example above, the first
% observation corresponds to key 1, the second to key 3, the third to key
% 3, and the 4th corresponds to key 1 again, and so forth. 
%

%% K-folds
% In the above example of cross validation, the user manually picked which
% data belonged to which fold. An alternative method is to use the
% <./functionReference/prtAction/kfolds.html kfolds> function. When calling kfolds,
% specify the number of folds you would like the data divided into. Kfolds
% will then randomly subdivide the data into the specified number of folds,
% and perform cross validation. For example:

nFolds = 3;
result = cluster.kfolds(ds,nFolds);

%%
% A final note about cross validation and kfolds, there are some actions
% that cross validation does not make sense, or is not possible (certain
% forms of outlier removal for example). In this case, a flag is set,
% indicating that cross-validation is not a valid operation, and calling
% crossValidate or kfolds on such an object will error.

%% Optimize
% Optimize is a function that allows the user to specify a range of values
% for a single parameter, and exhaustively determine which value of the
% parameter gives the best performance. The prtAction is run for every
% value of the parameter, and the performance is evaluated by a function
% specified in a function handle. Consider the following example, where we
% attempt to determine the optimal number of nearest neighbors for a
% K-nearest neigbor classifier:

ds = prtDataGenBimodal;  % Load a data set
knn = prtClassKnn;       % Create a classifier
kVec = 3:5:50;          % Create a vector of parameters to
                        % optimize over

% Optimize over the range of k values, using the area under the
% receiver operating curve as the evaluation metric. Validation
% is performed by a k-folds cross validation with
%10 folds as specified by the call to prtEvalAuc.

[knnOptimize, percentCorrects] = ...
    knn.optimize(ds,@(class,ds)prtEvalAuc(class,ds,10), 'k',kVec);
plot(kVec, percentCorrects);
xlabel('K values'); ylabel('Percent Correct');
