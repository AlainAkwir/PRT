% Pattern recognition is the science of making inferences based on data.
% Two primary forms of pattern recognition are _classification_ and
% _regression_.  In classification problems, data are collected and given
% discrete class labels.  In a regression problem, on the other hand,
% data labels are typically continuous values, not categorical.

% In both cases, let \mathcal{X} = {x_{i},y_{i}} where x_{i} represents the data
% collected, and y_{i} represents the corresponding data label for each
% sample x_{i}.  Usually, x_{i} is an N-dimensional real vector.  Each
