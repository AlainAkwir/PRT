PRT: Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning in MATLAB
=========

A free and permissively licensed object oriented approach to machine learning in MATLAB.

Machine learning and pattern recognition are eveywhere. MATLAB is a high level interpretted language and despite it's high cost to entry, it is frequently used throughout academia and engineering contractors for its easy of use and its numerous available toolboxes. Currently available toolboxes for pattern recognition and machine learning in MATLAB are either costly or restrictively licensed. The PRT is a BSD licensed toolbox that provides access to a wide range of pattern recognition techniques in an easy to use unified framework. The PRT provides an easy to use suite of MATLAB® commands and data-types to help you organize, visualize, process, cluster and classify your data. If you have data and need to make predictions based on your data, the PRT can help.
